# Code Retreat 2018

This is my progress using TDD to implement the Game of Life I started during the Global Code Retreat 2018 where I paired with different people learning from each other while thinking together on a solution for each challenge. But of course this is not complete solution.

Every person have their own way of thinking, so if you're going to use my code to cheat in next Code Retreats you're just fooling yourself and you won't get the most of the activity and the people you're going to meet.

However, my progress resolving the game might help you and your partners as a starting point for your initial tests.

I hope you'll enjoy thinking about the problem and looking different ways of solving it.
